try and except blocks are used in the begginig of code to deal with errors when we run code 
multiple times (it doesnt try to create folders everytime and show error)

 in every function whereever a file is opened ,it is closed and break is used to stop iterations 
in for loop after a required condition is met to reduce execution time!
